# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The main purpose of the challenge is to provide a report for an investment bank that is seeking to offer cryptocurrency investment portfolio. In the report the cryptocurrencies are shown on the trading market, and they are grouped to create a classification system this is done for the new investment. To perform the tasks for this project, I will perform unsupervised machine learning functions on data provided by CryptoCompare.

## Results

I cleaned the data to keep actively traded cryptocurrencies, and that also a defined algorithm, also it must have a complete set of data. With all theses standards set only 532 different cryptocurrencies remained. After that I created a three dimensional graph that represents the groups of the different cryptocurrencies. For each point it has a name and the algorithm used to create the currency.
